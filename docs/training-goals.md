# General Overview of the Training Goals

With this training session, we aim to help technical professionals initiate their journey in concepts and technologies around Kubernetes.
Our goal is to provide some insights and hands-on experience about the pros and cons of adopting Microservice-based architectures, understanding the different approaches and some of the technical tools to put it in place, such as Configuration (YAML), Containerization (Docker) and Kubernetes (Orchestration) from a developer's perspective.
