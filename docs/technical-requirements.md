For the training sessions to go as smoothly as possible, we'll need you to prepare for the session as we won't be able to assist with any installation issues during the session on-line.

## Hardware
 * PC or laptop with:
   * 2 CPUs or more
   * 2GB of free memory
   * 20GB of free disk space
 * Stable internet connection
 * Speakers and Microphone/Headset for Q&A
 * Webcam (optional because we respect your privacy)

## Software
 * Container or virtual machine manager, such as:
   * [VirtualBox](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/virtualbox/) (recommended for beginners)
   * [Docker](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/docker/) (favourite if you already use )
   * [Hyperkit](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/hyperkit/)
   * [Hyper-V](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/hyperv/)
   * [KVM](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/kvm2/)
   * [Parallels](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/parallels/) (recommended for MacOS - Paid)
   * [Podman](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/podman/)
   * [VMware Fusion/Workstation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/vmware/) (recommended for windows)
 * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/):
   * Note: For this class we will use \*Nix based containers so we recommend to prepare for the [WSL2 installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
 * Minikube: [installation guide](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
 * IDE/Text editor at choice
 * \*Nix terminal:
